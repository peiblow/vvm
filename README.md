# Synx Lang

An experimental programming language built from scratch in **Go**, with support for compilation into **bytecode** and execution on a **stack-based virtual machine**.  

This project is a practical study on language design, compilers, and virtual machines.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Compiler in Go**
  - Transforms the language AST into **bytecode**.  
  - Supports functions, variables, arrays, `for` loops, and primitive types (`int`, `string`, `null`).  
- **Virtual Machine (VM)**
  - Based on a **stack machine**.  
  - Instructions for arithmetic, control flow, arrays, and memory handling.  
  - Uses a `ConstPool` to store strings, numbers, and arrays.  
- **Memory management**
  - `storage` (persistent memory)  
  - `mstorage` (temporary memory)  
- **Supported types**
